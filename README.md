# EU-UK-Neighborhoods-Analysis
This project aims to find cities in the EU that match the character of major cities in the UK. The results of this analysis can be used as a guide to those who are looking to relocate from UK to EU.  

After much delay, The United Kingdom formally left the EU on 31 January 2020, following on a public vote held in June 2016. Members of Parliament have voted 358 to 234 in favor of the Withdrawal Agreement Bill to approve Boris Johnson's Brexit deal.  

The EU is an economic and political union involving 27 European countries. It allows free trade, which means goods can move between member countries without any checks or extra charges. The EU also allows free movement of people, to live and work in whichever country they choose. The UK joined in 1973 (when it was known as the European Economic Community) and became the first member state to leave.  

Given this imminent exit, businesses and people have already started making plans to relocate from their current locations in UK, back to a suitable place in EU. Multiple socio-economic and political factors influence the selection of suitable relocation of a city. Ideally people would like to relocate to a city that offers similar kinds of public amenities and lifestyle as their city of origin.
