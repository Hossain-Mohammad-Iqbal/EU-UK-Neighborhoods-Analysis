Members of Parliament have voted 358 to 234 in favor of the Withdrawal Agreement Bill to approve Boris Johnson's Brexit deal.\n\nThe EU is an economic and political union involving 27 European countries. It allows free trade, which means goods can move between member countries without any checks or extra charges. The EU also allows free movement of people, to live and work in whichever country they choose. The UK joined in 1973 (when it was known as the European Economic Community) and became the first member state to leave.\n\nUK's exit from Europe will result in increased difficulty of movement of people and good's between the EU and UK.  This seperation can have multiple adverse impacts on the UK like: Reduced EU market access, Damage to trade ties etc. Given this imminent exit, businesses and people have already started making plans to relocate from their current locations in UK, back to a suitable place in EU. Multiple socio-economic and political factors influence the selection of suitable relocation of a city. One of these factors is the presence of public amenities, lifestyle, cultural sites and eating places. Ideally people would like to relocate to a city that offers similar kinds of public amenities and lifestyle as their city of origin.\n\nWe will therefore try to find cities in the EU that match the character of major cities in the UK. The results of this analysis can be used as a guide to those who are looking to relocate from UK to EU.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Data","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\nWe will start with a list of cities in EU and UK along with their respective populations. The source of this would be Wikipedia. We can get a list of cities in the EU & UK by population within city limits from these links: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_in_the_European_Union_by_population_within_city_limits & https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_in_the_United_Kingdom. Then we will generate a list of cities with at least half a million population for further analysis.\n\nFor each of the city we will add geo-coordinates of the city center using GeoPy. With city center identified, we will use Foursquare API to gather a list of venues in a 20 km radius around the city. The venues will help us identify whether the city is filled with cultural sites or has a particular kind of restaurant etc. Using this list of venues, we will identify cities that have similar kind of venues so that we can suggest cities in EU that can serve as relocation substitutes for cities in UK.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Methodology","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\nOur list of cities with more than half a million population has a total of 64 cities. Of these 64, 11 cities are in the UK. The venues pulled from Foursquare have a total of 361 unique venue types. The top 5 most common venues are hotel, cafe, coffee shop, plaza and park.\n\nIn order to be able to suggest alternative cities for UK cities, we need to be able to cluster our 64 cities by the similarity of venues in them. We first calculate the frequency of occurrence of a venue type in each city and then rank them according to their frequency of occurrence.\n\nOur final dataset contains the top 10 most occurring venue types for each of our 64 cities. Since we need to classify these cities into similar clusters, we will be using k-means clustering algorithm. As the number of UK cities in our dataset are 11, we tentatively run the k-means algorithm with k=11.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Results","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Out of the 11 cluster of cities, 5 clusters (Cluster 0, 2, 5, 7, 8) do not have any city from UK so we can ignore them for the purpose of our problem. \n\n6 clusters (Cluster 1, 3, 4, 6, 9, 10) have cities from UK where there are also multiple other cities from the EU.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Discussion & Conclusion","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"For 11 big cities in UK we are able to suggest alternative city/cities in EU for relocation. Because, we have multiple cities in their respective clusters which can be considered by people or businesses looking to relocate in EU.\n\nOur analysis shows for every big UK cities we are able to find similar cities in the rest of the EU based on the characteristics of public venues, cultural sites, eating places and lifestyle. The results of this analysis clearly indicates that, it is poosible for the business owners to relocate their business in EU without impacting their business whatsoever.","metadata":{}}]}
